# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery Pipeline

## Introduction
This document provides an overview and detailed explanation of the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline setup using Jenkins and Argo CD, respectively.

## CI Part - Jenkins CI

### Overview
The CI pipeline automates the build, quality check, and packaging processes of the application using Jenkins.

### Workflow
- **Code Push**: Developers push code changes to BitBucket.
- **Maven Build**: Jenkins triggers a Maven build to prepare artifact files (.jar) for the Java application.
- **SonarQube Analysis**: The built artifacts are sent to SonarQube for code quality analysis. If the quality meets predefined thresholds, the process proceeds.
- **Artifact Publication**: Maven publishes the built artifacts to JFrog Artifactory.
- **Docker Image Creation**: Jenkins builds a Docker image using a Dockerfile, incorporating the artifact.
- **ECR Image Push**: The Docker image is pushed to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).

### Advantages:
- **Familiarity**: Jenkins is a widely-used CI tool with extensive community support and plugin ecosystem.
- **Flexibility**: Jenkins allows for customization of the CI pipeline to suit specific project requirements.
- **Integration**: Integrates seamlessly with other tools and services commonly used in the software development process.

## CD Part - Argo CD Setup

### Overview
The CD pipeline focuses on deploying the application to Kubernetes using Argo CD, a Continuous Delivery tool following the GitOps model.

### Workflow
- **CI Artifact Availability**: Argo CD expects CI to produce a deployable artifact, such as a Docker image or Helm chart.
- **BitBucket Repository Setup**: Deployment configurations, including Helm charts and deployment values, are maintained in a BitBucket repository.
- **Argo CD Configuration**: Argo CD is configured to monitor the BitBucket repository for changes.
- **Automatic Sync**: When changes are detected in the BitBucket repository, Argo CD automatically syncs with the Kubernetes API server to deploy the application.
- **Maintaining Desired State**: Argo CD ensures that the actual state of the application in the Kubernetes cluster matches the desired state specified in the BitBucket repository.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Environment-specific configurations, such as replica counts, are managed through separate values.yaml files for each environment (e.g., Dev, QA, Perf, Prod).

### Advantages of Argo CD
- **Continuous Syncing**: Argo CD continuously monitors and syncs the application state with the desired state, ensuring consistency.
- **GitOps Model**: Argo CD follows the GitOps model, allowing for version-controlled, declarative configuration management.
- **Automatic Remediation**: Argo CD automatically corrects any deviations from the desired state, enhancing reliability.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Argo CD supports environment-specific configurations, facilitating seamless deployments across different environments.

## Overall Advantages of Argo CD over Jenkins for CD

### Specialized Purpose
- Argo CD is purpose-built for continuous delivery, focusing specifically on deploying applications to Kubernetes clusters, while Jenkins is a general-purpose automation server.
### Declarative Configuration
- Argo CD relies on declarative configurations stored in version-controlled repositories, promoting consistency and reproducibility.
### Built-in Kubernetes Support
- Argo CD natively understands Kubernetes objects and resources, simplifying deployment and management of applications in Kubernetes environments.

## Conclusion
The CI/CD pipeline, consisting of Jenkins for CI and Argo CD for CD, automates the build, testing, packaging, and deployment processes, ensuring efficient software delivery and consistent application state across Kubernetes environments.
